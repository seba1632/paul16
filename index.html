            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>The "An Honest Man" by Michael Koryta is a gripping thriller that follows the story of Israel Pike, a recently paroled killer who discovers seven murdered men on a yacht near Salvation Point Island, Maine. Despite lacking evidence, Israel's uncle, Sterling Pike, immediately accuses him due to a past conviction for killing his father. FBI agent Jenn Salazar gets involved in the investigation, while 12-year-old Lyman Rankin, escaping his abusive father, encounters a mysterious woman. The novel weaves together the lives of Israel and Lyman, both products of harsh upbringings determined not to repeat their fathers' cruelty. The story is praised for its white-knuckle action, strong character development, and atmospheric prose, highlighting themes of honesty, integrity, and the impact of past traumas on individuals' lives.</p>
